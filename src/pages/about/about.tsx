        <p className="about-introduction">
          Hi there! My name is Krystian and I am a software engineer with a
          passion for creating efficient and innovative solutions. I am 25 years
          old and have had the opportunity to work as a full stack developer in
          a variety of settings. This experience has allowed me to become
          comfortable with acquiring new skills and technologies in a short
          amount of time. One of the things I enjoy most about being a software
          engineer is the opportunity to work with a team to solve problems and
          improve processes. I believe that collaboration is key to success, and
          I always try to take the time to discuss different approaches and
          solutions with my teammates. Linux is my favorite operating system,
          but I also don't mind using Windows or MacOS. I believe there are no
          unsolvable problems, only short deadlines. I am always up for a
          challenge and strive to meet the expectations with the highest level
          of quality in my work.

          I am the kind of person who can't really sit still for a long time,
          therefore I have many hobbies that keep me going. Here is a list of
          some of my favorite ones.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Playing ukulele</li>
          <li>Fixing and riding my motorcycle</li>
          <li>
            Philosophy (I used to be the head of philosophy panel in VIA
            Horsens)
          </li>
          <li>
            Guidance of young, passionate minds (I am a mentor for first
            semester students)
          </li>
          <li>
            Travelling (the main aim for my travels are beautiful hikes in
            nature and good food)
          </li>
          <li>Board games</li>
          <li>
            Computer games (strategy and RPG are the best way to run away from
            brutal reality from time to time)
          </li>
