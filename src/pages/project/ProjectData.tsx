// Projects information  ===============================================================================

// StarWars
const starWarsProjectTitle = "Star Wars game";

const starWarsProjectTechnologies = ["Java", "JavaFX"];

const starWarsProjectDescription = `This online shooter was developed in Java 8. It 
was an experiment to check how efficient can be a game written in JavaFX (which is
not designed at all for such a dynamic graphic). Results were surprisingly good, 
customly written engine that uses sockets and RMI for multiplayer gameplay 
provided quite satisfying results. It is a simple 2D shooter with basic collision 
physics, but thanks to nice graphics it provides a fun nostalgic experience.`;

// MovieToo
const movietooProjectTitle = "MovieToo";

const movietooProjectTechnologies = [
  "Angular",
  "TypeScript",
  "JWT",
  "Azure Cloud",
];

const movietooProjectDescription = `Azure cloud project that served as both a school project 
and a great opportunity to once more brush off on the Angular framework. The website 
can be browsed as a guest, however creating an account enables users to rate and
comment on movies. It is connected to the biggest database of movies on the internet,
but all the private information is of course stored in a separate database. This project
uses some popular Angular libraries for a neat look and nice animations. You are able to 
view movies statistics like rating over time, or see the most popular movies and actors. 
The project was deployed to the cloud using and supports full CI/CD (including Angular tests).`;

};

// MoviesAPI
const moviesAPIProjectTitle = "Movies API server and database";

const moviesAPITechnologies = ["Python", "Django", "JWT", "Azure Cloud"];

const moviesAPIProjectDescription = `Django python REST service and database responsible 
for getting information about movies from the external server and saving personal data 
like users, ratings, comments and more in the private database. This server supports both
authentication and authorization. Thanks to Django's simplicity it is very easy to add new 
endpoints and apply different types of permissions on them. Although no doubt it's slower than 
the Spring or .NET with Entity Framework that I am used to, it's fast enough for the users to 
not feel any discomfort. As an adventage it is much simpler to implement and is very maintnance 
friendly. This particular server is using JWT tokens for the authentication and authorization
process. The entire service was deployed to the Azure cloud and supports full CI/CD (including 
python tests).`;

// This website
const thisWebsiteProjectTitle = "This website";

const thisWebsiteProjectTechnologies = ["React", "TypeScript", "Google Cloud"];

const thisWebsiteProjectDescription = `If you are here you are already checking out one of my 
personal projects. It is a React typescript application currently deployed on Firebase with the use
of GitLab CI.CD. In the past it was deployed on Google Cloud, however fireabse is much more money efficient
for such small projects. Every cloud system has its tweaks and tricks, therefore I like to mix them up from 
time to time to stay up to date. Google Cloud requires a bit more work when it comes to setting up 
a proper CI/CD than AWS or Azure, therefore I encourage to checkout the old yaml files in the repository. 
The website is a classic example of React component based application, that makes use of the best 
functionalities like states. I hope you played with  the particles on the home page!`;

// Embedded
const embeddedProjectTitle = "Embedded solution for sensors";

const embeddedProjectTechnologies = ["C", "FreeRTOS"];

const embeddedProjectDescription = `C software written with use of the FreeRTOS operating system 
kernel. By connecting the specified sensors to Arduino and using the provided codebase, one can 
measure temperature, CO2 and humidity levels in real time. All of the data will be send to the 
receiver through LoRa network, which can be read later on by external services (f.e. Spring).`;

// Data layer
const dataLayerProjectTitle = "Data Layer for Scrum Management Tool";

const dataLayerProjectTechnologies = ["Java", "Spring", "JPA"];

const dataLayerProjectDescription = `Old (3 years in programming years is old) solution for the data 
layer implemented with Java Spring and JPA. No doubt Spring is my favorite REST service. Easy to use, 
highly customizable and the maintnance is a pure pleasure if the project follows the recommended 
architecture. The same applies to this case, although some things are a bit outdated the 
structure is so clean that there would be no problem to jump in and tweak the solution. JPA 
made the work here incredibly easy and pleasant.`;

// Scrum client
const scrumClientProjectTitle = "Client for Scrum Management Tool";

const scrumClientProjectTechnologies = [".NET", "Razor", "JavaScript"];

const scrumClientProjectDescription = `A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away we were using .NET 3 
and Razor to create interactive websites with Microsoft frameworks. This was one of my first bigger 
projects. Razor is definietely light-years behind Blazor, but with help of JavaScript it still turned 
out to be a nice interactive website for organizing agile development. Users can create tasks, assign 
roles and much, much more. Defineitely not the technology that I would recommend to anyone nowadays, 
but a nostalgic look back, when my adventure with programming was starting to gain the momentum.`;

};

// Business layer
const businessLayerProjectTitle = "Business layer for Scrum Management Tool";

const businessLayerProjectTechnologies = ["Java", "Spring"];

const businessLayerProjectDescription = `Could you create a REST service that will.." YES, THE ANSWER 
IS SPRING. In all honesty that part of the distributed system is completely artificial in this case, 
but the client wanted the entirety to be super flexible. Therefore here we go, a business layer! If 
you want to see the diagram for the architecture, click on the Spring image, it is displayed in 
README.md in the repo. As a business layer should, this applicaiton handles the business rules, 
calculations and cleans up the data before forwarding it to the Data Layer.`;

// Froggers
const froggersProjectTitle = "Unity 2D game";

const froggersProjectTechnologies = ["Unity", ".NET"];

const froggersProjectDescription = `Coding is not only my job, but also my hobby. It is difficult to
come up with more fun part of coding than creating games of course! In my free time I developed a fun
2D platformer with custom AI and much more. Check out the Game tab if you didn't see it yet!`;
